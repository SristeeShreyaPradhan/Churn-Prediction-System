# 🔁 Churn Prediction System

A machine learning project that predicts which customers are likely to stop using a service. This kind of churn model is vital in industries like telecom, SaaS, and banking—where retaining customers is more profitable than acquiring new ones.

## ✅ What This Project Does

- Loads and explores customer data (e.g., telecom )
- Cleans and engineers features like contract type, service usage, and payment method
- Trains classification models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
- Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and churn probabilities
- Visualizes churn insights using Power BI 
- Presents results in a dashboard or business report

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Used

- 🔍 Classification Modeling (Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
- 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Pandas)
- 📊 Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Precision/Recall)
- 📈 Business Insight Visualization (Power BI or Matplotlib)
- 📉 Churn Probability Analysis
